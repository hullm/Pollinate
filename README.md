# Pollinate
Modified version of bootstrappr that works with our inventory system.  You can add Setup.plist to munki to finish setting up a computer after it's been pollinated.  

BumbleBee can be added to an Arduino to execute pollinate automatically.  Boot into recovery, open the terminal, and plug in the Arduino with BumbleBee loaded and it will pollinate the computer for you.
